## Neo4j

open-source NoSQL database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. The main strength of Neo4j is its ability to quickly execute complex queries across large datasets.

## Cypher

Cypher is the query language for Neo4j, designed to be intuitive and efficient for working with graph data. 
- Uses an ASCII-art syntax to express patterns in the graph for matching and querying data.
- Allows Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on both nodes and relationships.
- Supports aggregating data and ordering query results, similar to SQL.
- Provides built-in functions and allows expressions for data manipulation and transformation.
- Designed to efficiently execute complex queries involving deep traversal and pattern matching.
